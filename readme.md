# YouTube Analytics - Data

## what's the purpose of this repository?

this repository **holds** *some data* from my youtube channel, mainly the **likes** & **dislikes** my videos received

i want to be transparent on how my videos perform

## can't you and me just rely on dislikes provided from [Return Youtube Dislike?](https://returnyoutubedislike.com/)

while it does a **decent job** at displaying the *"probable"* amount of **dislikes** a video has, it's still **mediocre** for me

by getting my dislike data myself from youtube studio, this makes the votes extremely accurate, like 1:1
